### Guiding principles

In every software project the question "what to focus on" arises on a daily basis. To help us in this question, we postulate a few guiding principles.

1. We value polished and "juicy" features that make users happy over the amount of available features.
2. When introducing new features we value thought through processes including reafactoring that make the application coherrent over adding a feature fast.
3. To support the above we value "re-factorable" code over architectures that try to take all possible future cases into consideration.
4. We value features in the hand of our users over fully polished features.
